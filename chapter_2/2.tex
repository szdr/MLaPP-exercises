\subsection*{(a)}
\begin{table}[htbp]

If the neighbor has any boys, there is only a chance to the first of the three rows in the above table.
In this situation, the probability that one child is a girl is $\frac{2}{3}$.
\subsection*{(b)}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(Run=C1)\cdot P(C2=G|Run=C1)+P(Run=C2)\cdot P(C1=G|Run=C2) & = & \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\\ & = & \frac{1}{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
